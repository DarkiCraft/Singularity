# SingularityLib

(I CAN FINALLY WORK ON THIS AGAIN IN THE SUMMERS WOOHOOO!!!)

SingularityLib is a C++ header-only Linear Algebra library heavily inspired by [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) with a focus on compile-time metaprogramming.

## What this project aims to do:
- Allow Linear Algebra operations on matrices, vectors, and fields.
- Provide pluggable, user-defined storage backends (Cores) with full operation support.
- Be a fun and educational project for me.

## What this project does NOT aim to do:
- Compete with Eigen or any major Linear Algebra library. This is not production-grade and never will be.
- Guarantee perfectly optimized runtime performance. I’m not chasing matrix optimization — this is a personal learning journey, not a benchmark contest.

## Status:
Haven't worked on this in a while because of exams but I intend to in the very near future.

I appreciate all criticism, and all support <3
